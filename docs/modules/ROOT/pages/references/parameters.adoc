type:: object
default::
+
[source,yaml]
----
default: text
----

This parameter exposes the log format for the ArgoCD components.
By default, all components are configured to use the log format given for key `default`.
The log format can be customized for individual components by providing the desired log format in keys `server`, `application_controller` or `repo_server`.

== `log_level`

[horizontal]
type:: object
default::
+
[source,yaml]
----
default: info
----

This parameter exposes the log level for the ArgoCD components.
By default, all components are configured with the log level given in key `default`.

This parameter is only used when the cluster's catalog repo URL starts with `https://`.

IMPORTANT: Users must ensure that this secret is in place before this component is synced.

== `images`

[horizontal]
type:: dictionary

Dictionary containing the container images used by this component.
Each entry follows the https://syn.tools/syn/explanations/commodore-components/container-images.html[Commodore component best practices] for specifying container images.

== `instances`

[horizontal]
type:: dictionary
default:: `{}`

This section allows the definition of arbitrary `ArgoCD` instances, and associated `AppProject` resources.
The keys of this parameter are parsed as namespaced names (`<namespace>/<name>`) and used as namespaces and names of the created resources.

[IMPORTANT]
.Namespace management
====
. Each `ArgoCD` instance must be deployed to its own namespace
. You MUST create the target namespace _manually_ before deploying ArgoCD using this component

Due to how Argo CD works, namespaces holding Argo CD instances cannot be created by other Argo CD instances.

See https://argocd-operator.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/argocd/[the `ArgoCD` reference of the Argo CD Operator] for available fields.

To avoid common issues, some defaults are configured.
They can be overwritten via the inventory.


=== `instances.<namespace>/<name>.projects`

[horizontal]
type:: dictionary
default:: `{}`

Arbitrary `AppProject` instances to be deployed on the cluster.

The keys of this parameter are used as the generated resource's `metadata.name`, while the parent `ArgoCD`'s namespace will be inherited.

Dictionary containing the resource requests and limits for the different
components. Keys correspond to different pods/containers:

* `application_controller`
* `redis`
* `repo_server`
* `repo_server_vault_agent` - for the `vault_agent` container in the `repo-server` pod
* `server`

Users can remove configured requests and limits by setting any keys or subkeys in the dictionary to `null`.

----

A dictionary of resource exclusions for the ArgoCD instance.
Those resources will not be managed by ArgoCD.

The keys are the names of the exclusion groups.
Keys are not used, they are exclusively for hierarchical structuring.

The values are lists of resource definitions that should be excluded from the ArgoCD instance.
Those lists get concatenated.

Check https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user-guide/resource_tracking/#additional-tracking-methods-via-an-annotation[ArgoCD documentation] for more information.


== `operator`

[horizontal]
type:: dict
defaults:: https://github.com/projectsyn/component-argocd/blob/master/class/defaults.yml[See `class/defaults.yml`]

Configuration for the ArgoCD operator which is deployed as part of this component.


=== `operator.namespace`

[horizontal]
type:: string
default:: `syn-argocd-operator`

The namespace in which to deploy the argocd operator

=== `operator.cluster_scope_namespaces`

[horizontal]
type:: array
default:: `["${argocd:namespace}"]`

List of namespaces in which argocd is allowed to be installed at the cluster scope.

=== `operator.controller_cluster_role_selectors`

[horizontal]
type:: dictionary
default:: `{}`

The component has optional support to configure the operator's https://argocd-operator.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage/custom_roles/[custom roles] feature.
When this parameter contains one or more entries, the component deploys a cluster role which uses the value of each parameter entry as an entry for `aggregationRule.clusterRoleSelectors`.
The cluster role is named `syn:argocd-application-controller:custom`.
Additionally, the component configures environment variable `CONTROLLER_CUSTOM_ROLE=syn:argocd-application-controller:custom` on the operator container when the parameter isn't empty.

When the aggregating cluster role is deployed, the component also deploys a cluster role called `syn:argocd-application-controller:required` which is aggregated to the `syn:argocd-application-controller:custom` role.

The `syn:argocd-application-controller:required` role grants the ArgoCD application controller a number of permissions that are required for it to work.
See the definition of the role in https://github.com/projectsyn/component-argocd/blob/master/component/rbac.jsonnet[component/rbac.jsonnet] for the rules that are required.

[TIP]
====
We recommend setting `resource.respectRBAC=strict` via `spec.extraConfig` on namespace-scoped ArgoCD instances if you want to use custom roles.

If you don't set `resource.respectRBAC`, you'll need to create a cluster role which grants the application controller read access to all resources in the cluster in order to ensure that the application controller can create the K8s API cache.

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRole
metadata:
  name: argocd-application-controller-api-cache
  labels:
    syn.tools/aggregate-to-argocd-application-controller: "true" <1>
rules:
- apiGroups: ['*']
  resources: ['*']
  verbs: ['get', 'list', 'watch']
----
<1> The example assumes that you've configured `syn.tools/aggregate-to-argocd-application-controller="true"` as the label selector for the application controller aggregating cluster role.
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
ArgoCD may fail to update the argocd-operator deployment if you remove this config parameter after having used it.
If you get an error like the one shown below, you need to edit the argocd-operator deployment by hand to remove the `CONTROLLER_CLUSTER_ROLE` environment variable after you remove this config parameter.
